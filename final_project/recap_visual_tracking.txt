learned policy = funct aka NN
the agent has to predict the target location (bounding box) in a frame


The state is generally an image representing the content of the current bounding box.
action = transformation to current bounding box 
Goal: shift the box for follow the target
rewards: intersection of current box over the real target box

value-based algorithms, 
policy gradient methods,
and actor-critic approaches


VISUAL TRACKING FORMUKATION

2d visual object tracking (VOT) single camera
tracking by detection : training onlinea detector
	binary classification : target/non-target
	
	tracking by-detection algorithms suffered from the problem
	of defining suitable feature representations to discriminate
	between target and backgroun
